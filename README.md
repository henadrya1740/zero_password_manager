No third-party access.  
No cloud providers.  
No tracking.

Just **you and your data**.

# 🚀 Key Features

## ☁️ No Cloud. Ever.
Most password managers store your data in **third-party cloud infrastructure**.

**Zero Password Manager does not.**

✔ Your data stays **only on your server**  
✔ No Google Cloud  
✔ No AWS  
✔ No external storage  
✔ No data mining  

This ensures **true data ownership and privacy**.

---

## 🔑 Secure Password Vault
Safely store and manage:
- website logins
- API keys
- private credentials
- personal secrets

All data is stored in a **secure encrypted vault** using **AES-256-GCM**. Master password never leaves your device (**Zero-Knowledge**).

---

## 📁 Password Folders
Organize your passwords into **custom folders** for easier navigation and management:
- Create folders with a **custom name, color** (12 color presets) **and icon** (16 icons to choose from)
- A **horizontal folder bar** on the main vault screen lets you filter passwords by folder in one tap
- **Assign a folder** when adding or editing any password entry (optional)
- Open the **Folders screen** ("Manage" button in the folder bar) to create, edit, rename, recolor, or delete folders
- Deleting a folder **never deletes its passwords** — they simply become unassigned
- Full REST API support: `GET /folders` · `POST /folders` · `PUT /folders/{id}` · `DELETE /folders/{id}`
- Backend stores folder ownership per user — **no cross-user data leakage**

---

## 🛡️ Hardened 2FA
Built-in support for TOTP (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Aegis, etc.).
- Mandatory 2FA setup during registration.
- OTP-gated critical actions.
- Replay attack protection.

# 📦 Local Deployment (No Cloud Needed)

Zero Password Manager is designed to be self-hosted in your own local environment.

## 🐍 1. Backend Setup (FastAPI)
The server handles authentication, audit logs, and stores encrypted blobs.

1.  **Navigate to the server directory**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment**:
    Copy `env.example` to `.env` and set your `JWT_SECRET_KEY`.
4.  **Launch the Server**:
    ```bash
    python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
    ```
    *The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.*

### 📱 2. Flutter App Setup
Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed.

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
2.  **Configuration**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (based on `env.example`). Set `API_BASE_URL` to point to your server's IP.
3.  **Run the App**:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### 📦 3. Mobile Build (Android & iOS)

To build the application for mobile devices:
